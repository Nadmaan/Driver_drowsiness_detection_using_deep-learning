# Driver_drowsiness_detection_using_deep-learning

Countless people use the highway at all hours of the day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, and long-distance travellers all suffer from sleep deprivation. As a result, driving when sleepy becomes extremely dangerous.

The majority of accidents occur as a result of the driver's tiredness. So, to avoid these accidents, we'll be developing a model using Python, OpenCV, and Keras to create a system that will inform the driver when he gets tired. The implementation of this project idea in actual world could save the life of a random driver and will be extremely useful.
